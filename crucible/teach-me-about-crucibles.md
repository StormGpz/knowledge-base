# Invata-ma despre Crucible NFT

## Ce este un Crucible NFT?

Crucible este un NFT reprezentand valoarea LP pe care ai alocat-o lui. Actul de a creea un Crucible se numeste “minting” termen folosit la baterea de monede, noi numindu-l aici creare Crucible.

Cand un Crucible NFT are LP token alocat in Aludel, detinatorul primeste anumite cantitati de tokeni ⚗️MIST si ETH ca recompnesa. Cantitatea totala disponibila pentru acest fond de recompensa este de 50% din cei 1% ⚗️MIST intrati in circulatie ca rata de inflatie la fiecare 14 zile, plus o cantitate de ETH obtinuta din fondul initial de pe Balancer. Crucible NFT-urile cu LP-ul intrat in Aludel primesc o parte procentual egala din recompensele totale raportat la LP-ul total din Aludel dar si raportat la durata de timp în care LP-ul lor a fost alocat in Aludel, totul comparativ si raportat la LP-ul celorlalti participanti.

### What is an NFT?

Ce este un NFT? NFT inseamna Non Fungibil Token, adica ceva care, ca si token, are reprezentare unica.

NFTurile sunt in direct contrast cu monedele, tokeni obisnuiti:

* Monedele, tokenii obisnuiti: 1⚗️MIST is 1⚗️MIST, au utilitate si valoare echivalenta
* NFT-urile: 1 Crucible NFT in cele mai multe cazuri nu este egal in valoare cu alt 1 Crucible NFT deoarece reprezinta valori unice.

Aceasta caracterisitica a unui NFT token este un punct de intelegere necesar, deoarece unii deja au listat propriul lor Crucible NFT la vanzare in platforma de vanzare cumparare, poti vedea asta in Opensea [aici](https://opensea.io/assets/0x54e0395cfb4f39bef66dbcd5bd93cca4e9273d56/620479970925497750675476517677400441094103376596). La timpul redactarii acestui material un Crucible in Opensea este listat la 0.77 ETH. Merita atat?

Pentru a fi cat mai clari tinem sa mentionam ca daca ai creat un Crucible NFT tu inca ai profit din staking in fondul de lichiditate Uniswap fiind efectiv angajat ca potential castig in toate cele 3 modalitati.

###  It stands for Non-Fungible Token. If that word is too big for you, you can think of "non-fungible" as meaning "unique". <a id="Cat-valoreaza-un-Crucible-NFT"></a>

NFTs are a direct contrast to coins:

* Coins: 1⚗️ is 1⚗️, they have equivalent value and use
* NFTs: 1 Crucible NFT is not another 1 Crucible NFT and it is very unlikely that any two Crucibles have equivalent value

This is an important point to understand, because people have [already started listing](https://opensea.io/assets/0x54e0395cfb4f39bef66dbcd5bd93cca4e9273d56/620479970925497750675476517677400441094103376596) their Crucibles for sale on platforms such as OpenSea.

It's worth mentioning for the sake of clarity: if you mint a Crucible, you are still also staking ⚗️ in the Uniswap-V2 liquidity pool as well. You are effectively engaging in all 3 ways of potentially earning.

## How do you mint a Crucible?

Originally the only method was getting to grips with the official CLI tool. Fortunately, community members have since created web-apps that makes the process a lot easier. Due to the extra risk of making mistakes whilst using the CLI tool it is no longer recommended to take that approach. 

Please use the guide below to mint a Crucible:

## What is a Crucible worth?

The value of a Crucible is difficult to determine. The NFT nature of the Crucible could potentially make it have speculative value beyond the its immediate worth, but some Crucibles may be considered more special than others.

Speculation aside, however, what we do know is that a Crucible is created with some variable amount of LP tokens inside, which have an immediately measurable value. 

At a minimum, you could value a crucible based on what you would receive back for unsubscribing its LP contents and trading back to your fiat currency.

Refer to [this section](teach-me-about-crucibles.md#how-can-i-check-how-many-lp-tokens-someone-elses-crucible-is-worth) below for methods to check the contents of a Crucible.

## Should you mint a Crucible?

That is for you to decide. Ensure you understand what could gain, what you could lose, and then weigh up whether you think it's a good choice for you.

#### The cost of minting

When dealing with Ethereum based tokens and contracts you will face gas fees at almost every stage. 

Gas prices continuously fluctuate and this plays a major role on how much gas you are expected to pay, for this reason we are unable to give an indication.

We can say however, that you should take into account the value of your LP tokens against the cost of gas when you are about to submit a transaction to mint a crucible.

#### The tools

Our guides have been based on our wallet of choice, MetaMask![](../.gitbook/assets/metamask-fox.svg). If you need advise regarding the use of other wallets, pop into our [discord](http://discord.alchemist.wtf) channel and the community will be happy to answer.

{% hint style="warning" %}
MetaMask will not recognise or display your Crucible tokens until you [add the token addresses](faq.md#why-cant-i-see-my-mist-in-my-wallet) to the application. 
{% endhint %}

## What wallets can I use to store my Crucible?

Crucibles are ERC-721 tokens and signing these transactions are not supported by all Wallet Applications. 

Please refer to our [wallet compatibility guide.](wallet-compatibility.md)

## How much LP tokens do I need to create a Crucible?

Community members have successfully minted a Crucible with as low as 0.1 LP tokens.

Of course, a Crucible still costs gas to mint, so please take into consideration this cost when creating one with minimal LP.

Remember, you earn rewards proportional to your LP share of the total LP staked in the Aludel.

## Can I create multiple Crucibles?

Yes. Many users in the community have already minted multiple Crucibles.

Whether this is beneficial or not, this is up to you to decide.

## How can I check how many LP tokens someone else's Crucible is worth?

You can take the take the Crucible's token ID, convert it into hexadecimal \(if it is in decimal\) and then search for the address on [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io).

This will display what the contents are and the history of transactions that have occurred within the Crucible.

If you can't see any tokens displayed for it, then it's most likely empty.

## How do I view my tokens on MetaMask ![](../.gitbook/assets/metamask-fox.svg) ?

Refer to [our FAQ ](faq.md#why-cant-i-see-my-mist-in-my-wallet)on the addresses that you need to add to your wallet to be able to see the token.
