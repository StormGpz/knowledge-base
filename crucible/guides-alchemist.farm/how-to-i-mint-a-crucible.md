# How do I mint a Crucible?

## Swapping and Subscribing $MIST ⚗️ to mint a Crucible

First of all, you need to have $MIST and subscribe it to the Uniswap-V2 Liquidity pool.

If you have not done this already, please refer to our 2-part guide on [Acquiring & Subscribing](../../acquiring-and-subscribing.md).

## Minting a Crucible using LP tokens

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important information:** 

Do not use Brave browser as it is not compatible with the process at this time and your transaction will fail, resulting in lost fees. 

We do not recommend using a hardware wallet at this time as many do not currently support EIP-712 signing. When they fix this, we can implement it.

We do not recommend you do this on a mobile

### Video Guides

Churchee has kindly created two videos demonstrating how things work once you've got your LP tokens. You might find these easier to follow or more informative than this text based guide:
