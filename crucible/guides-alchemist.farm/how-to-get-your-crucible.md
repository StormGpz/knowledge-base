# How to get your Crucible

## Swapping and Staking $MIST ⚗️ to mint a Crucible

If you have already got your $MIST ⚗️ and subscribed it to the LP on Uniswap-V2, skip this section and jump straight across to [Minting a Crucible](how-to-get-your-crucible.md#minting-the-crucible-with-lp-tokens).

### 1. Getting $MIST ⚗️

Ever traded coins on Uniswap? If so you know how to do this already.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Due to low liquidity on **Uniswap V3**, extra slippage might mean you will not get the best price for your purchase. Please use our **Uniswap V2** link below to perform the token swap.
{% endhint %}

1. Head to [Swap $MIST on Uniswap V2](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x88acdd2a6425c3faae4bc9650fd7e27e0bebb7ab&use=V2)
2. Connect MetaMask wallet
3. You should see something like this:

4. Enter the amount of ⚗️ you wish to purchase, ensuring you have an equivalent value of ETH remaining to use for the staking
5. Hit "Swap", make necessary approvals via MetaMask, wait for the transaction to complete
   * I found that my first two attempts failed, seemingly because they weren't being processed fast enough for the price to remain stable before they finished
   * MetaMask has the ability to let you speed up a transaction by locating it in the "Activity" tab and choosing to pay more gas for higher priority processing
6. Navigate to [https://etherscan.io/address/](https://etherscan.io/address/) to view pending transactions and all tokens associated with your account.
   * if you use MetaMask you can click the triple dots and then "View on Etherscan" to jump to it:

7. You should see your new ⚗️ displayed like the following:

### 2. Staking $MIST ⚗️ to receive LP tokens

Ever provided liquidity on Uniswap? If so you know how to do this already.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Crucible only supports the **Uniswap V2** Liquidity Pool.   
Adding liquidity to the **Uniswap V3** pool is not compatible with the Rewards Program.
{% endhint %}

1. Head to [Add LP to $MIST on Uniswap V2](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/v2/0x88acdd2a6425c3faae4bc9650fd7e27e0bebb7ab/ETH)
   * Connect MetaMask wallet if not already done so
2. You should see something like this:

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/7paIEyF.png)

3. Enter the amounts you want to stake. Both sides need to be equal value, so changing one will change the other. You most likely just want to click the "MAX" button on the ⚗️ side
4. Hit "Stake", make necessary approvals via MetaMask, wait for the transaction to complete
5. You should see your new LP tokens \(named UNI-V2\) on Etherscan again:

## Minting a Crucible with LP tokens

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important information:** 

Do not use Brave browser as it is not compatible with the process at this time and your transaction will fail resulting in lost fees. 

We do not recommend using a hardware wallet at this time as many do not currently support EIP-712 signing. When they fix this, we can implement it.

We do not recommend you do this on a mobile
{% endhint %}

1. Firstly Head to [https://alchemist.farm/](https://alchemist.farm/)
2. Connect MetaMask wallet
3. You should see something like this:

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/eimfv0e.png)

4. Enter the amount of LP you wish you put into the Crucible. You probably wish to click "Max" to enter your full amount
5. Hit "Mint cruicible and Subscribe LP to Aludel", make necessary approvals via MetaMask, wait for the transaction to complete
6. You should see your new Crucible on Etherscan:

**Congratulations, if you've made it this far, you're an Alchemist**

## Some other questions you may have:

### How do I get that fancy "Certified Alchemist" role on the Discord server?

Please follow the guide [here](../how-to-become-a-certified-alchemist-on-discord.md)

### How can I check how many LP tokens is in my Crucible?

You can use [https://alchemist.farm/](https://alchemist.farm/) to view your Crucible:

![](https://i.imgur.com/WCBz8yM.png)

As you can see it also displays several other useful metrics to track the performance.

### How can I check how many LP tokens someone else's Crucible is worth?

You can take the take the Crucible's tokenId, convert it into hexadecimal if it is in decimal instead, and then search for the address on [https://etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io) to check what the contents are. If you can't see any tokens displayed for it, then it's most likely empty.

### How much LP tokens do I need to create a Crucible?

I don't know what the requirement is, but people have reported creating one with as low as 0.5 LP tokens. It would not surprise me if it was possible with 0.

Of course, a Crucible still costs gas to mint, so creating one with ~0 LP inside costs you money to create what is at present a worthless item.

Remember, you earn ⚗️ rewards proportional to your LP share of the total LP staked in the Aludel.

### Can I create multiple Crucibles?

Yes. Some people have already.

Again, every transaction is costing you in gas though, so the wisdom of creating multiple instead of just one is in question.

### How do I know if I've subscribed the LP within my Crucible?

It should be done automatically. You can also use [https://alchemist.farm/](https://alchemist.farm/) to check on your Crucible. There will be a padlock icon in the upper right corner of the Crucible display which indicates the amount of LP that has been subscribed to the Aludel reward program: ![](https://i.imgur.com/ed4d3m8.png)

### How do I check my Aludel rewards?

You can use [https://alchemist.farm/](https://alchemist.farm/) to display your Crucibles, where it will list your current ⚗️ and ETH rewards.

### If I've minted my Crucible and subscribed my LP... is that it?

Yes. Now you sit back and see what happens.
