# How do I mint a Crucible?

## Swapping and Staking $MIST ⚗️ to mint a Crucible

First of all, you need to have $MIST and subscribe it to the Uniswap-V2 Liquidity pool.

If you have already got your $MIST ⚗️ and subscribed it to the LP on Uniswap-V2, skip this section and jump straight across to [Minting a Crucible](how-to-get-your-crucible.md#minting-the-crucible-with-lp-tokens).

### 1. Getting $MIST ⚗️

Ever traded coins on Uniswap? If so you know how to do this already.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Due to low liquidity on **Uniswap V3**, extra slippage might mean you will not get the best price for your purchase. Please use our **Uniswap V2** link below to perform the token swap.
{% endhint %}

1. Head to [Swap $MIST on Uniswap V2](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x88acdd2a6425c3faae4bc9650fd7e27e0bebb7ab&use=V2)
2. Connect MetaMask wallet
3. You should see something like this:

4. Enter the amount of ⚗️ you wish to purchase, ensuring you have an equivalent value of ETH remaining to use for the staking
5. Hit "Swap", make necessary approvals via MetaMask, wait for the transaction to complete
   * I found that my first two attempts failed, seemingly because they weren't being processed fast enough for the price to remain stable before they finished
   * MetaMask has the ability to let you speed up a transaction by locating it in the "Activity" tab and choosing to pay more gas for higher priority processing
6. Navigate to [https://etherscan.io/address/](https://etherscan.io/address/) to view pending transactions and all tokens associated with your account.
   * if you use MetaMask you can click the triple dots and then "View on Etherscan" to jump to it:

7. You should see your new ⚗️ displayed like the following:

### 2. Staking $MIST ⚗️ to receive LP tokens

Ever provided liquidity on Uniswap? If so you know how to do this already.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Crucible only supports the **Uniswap V2** Liquidity Pool.   
Adding liquidity to the **Uniswap V3** pool is not compatible with the Rewards Program.
{% endhint %}

1. Head to [Add LP to $MIST on Uniswap V2](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/v2/0x88acdd2a6425c3faae4bc9650fd7e27e0bebb7ab/ETH)
   * Connect MetaMask wallet if not already done so
2. You should see something like this:

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/7paIEyF.png)

3. Enter the amounts you want to stake. Both sides need to be equal value, so changing one will change the other. You most likely just want to click the "MAX" button on the ⚗️ side
4. Hit "Stake", make necessary approvals via MetaMask, wait for the transaction to complete
5. You should see your new LP tokens \(named UNI-V2\) on Etherscan again:

## Minting a Crucible with LP tokens

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important information:** 

Do not use Brave browser as it is not compatible with the process at this time and your transaction will fail resulting in lost fees. 

We do not recommend using a hardware wallet at this time as many do not currently support EIP-712 signing. When they fix this, we can implement it.

We do not recommend you do this on a mobile

### Video Guides

Churchee has kindly created two videos demonstrating how things work once you've got your LP tokens. You might find these easier to follow or more informative than this text based guide:

{% hint style="info" %}
Links to Uniswap in videos may be outdated since the launch of Uniswap V3.  
Please ensure to use **Uniswap V2** or refer to our links found in this documentation.
