# I have Minted a Crucible, now what?

## How do I get that fancy "Certified Alchemist" role on the Discord server?

Please follow the guide [here](../how-to-become-a-certified-alchemist-on-discord.md)

### How can I check how many LP tokens is in my Crucible?

You can use [https://alchemist.farm/](https://alchemist.farm/) to view your Crucible:

As you can see it also displays several other useful metrics to track the performance.

## How can I check how many LP tokens someone else's Crucible is worth?

You can take the take the Crucible's tokenId, convert it into hexadecimal if it is in decimal instead, and then search for the address on [https://etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io) to check what the contents are. If you can't see any tokens displayed for it, then it's most likely empty.

## How much LP tokens do I need to create a Crucible?

I don't know what the requirement is, but people have reported creating one with as low as 0.5 LP tokens. It would not surprise me if it was possible with 0.

Of course, a Crucible still costs gas to mint, so creating one with ~0 LP inside costs you money to create what is at present a worthless item.

Remember, you earn ⚗️ rewards proportional to your LP share of the total LP staked in the Aludel.

## Can I create multiple Crucibles?

Yes. Some people have already.

Again, every transaction is costing you in gas though, so the wisdom of creating multiple instead of just one is in question.

## How do I know if I've subscribed the LP within my Crucible?

It should be done automatically. You can also use [https://alchemist.farm/](https://alchemist.farm/) to check on your Crucible. There will be a padlock icon in the upper right corner of the Crucible display which indicates the amount of LP that has been subscribed to the Aludel reward program: ![](https://i.imgur.com/ed4d3m8.png)

## How do I check my Aludel rewards?

You can use [https://alchemist.farm/](https://alchemist.farm/) to display your Crucibles, where it will list your current ⚗️ and ETH rewards.

## If I've minted my Crucible and subscribed my LP... is that it?

Yes. Now you sit back and see what happens.
